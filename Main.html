        <H1 style=" font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif"> What is a Network?</H1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;"> A network is like an organised arrangement, in which there are more than 2 computers, that are joined 
        to share content or even interchange files; there are countless uses of a networks. Computers in a network are connected
        by the help of many gadgets or wirelessly. There are different networks used in the industries based on size and connectivity required</p>
        <h2 style=" font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif">Types of network include:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Local area network</li>
            <p>LAN or Local Area network consists of devices connected at a perticular area. The connectivity ranges from a few meters in a house
                to a hundred meters for a building. LAN's are mostly safe and secure since they are traditionally wired. They use Ethernet cables
                which helps in faster communication. Example - University network.
            </p> <br>

            <li>Metropolitan Area Network</li>
            <p>MAN or Metropolitan Area Network is a network whiich connects many LAN's at once. They can be either wired or wireless. MAN's
                motice is to have a perticular network available at several places. Many government parts use this kind of network as they are 
                spread over a lot of places. Example - Telephone networks providing high-speed DSL lines.

            <li>Wide Area Network</li>
            <p>WAN's are network is similar to MAN but WAN's isnt restrcited to a perticular location, but can be 
                specific state/country. Examples include - library database for students.
            </p> <br>

            <li>Personal Area Network </li>
            <p> A PAN is a network smaller than LAN, as it ranges a few meters. They are either wired or wireless.
                They are a common network for everyday practises. Example - connecting Smartphone and Speaker.
